        Hello this is orion! I have hijacked react and I'm holding Meta workers
        hostage. The only way to release them is to transfer all knowledge in
        the form of knowledge capsules so that i can learn coding
        instantatiously and not have to work a day in my life so i can relax on
        the beach whilst watching anime for the remainder of my life.
